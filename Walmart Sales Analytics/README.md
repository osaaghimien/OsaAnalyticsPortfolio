# Walmart Store Sales Analytics

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes Walmart store sales from February 2010 to October 2012 to uncover sales trends, holiday performance patterns, and the impact of external economic factors. The analysis focuses on identifying underperforming periods and market conditions that represent missed revenue opportunities.

Using Power BI, the project translates historical sales and economic data into actionable insights that support better promotional planning, inventory strategy, and revenue optimization.

## 🎯 Business Problem
Walmart’s sales performance varies significantly across time, stores, and economic conditions. Despite strong overall revenue, fluctuations during key holiday periods and differences across unemployment environments indicate missed opportunities for revenue maximization.

The challenge is identifying **when and where** sales underperform despite favorable conditions, and quantifying the potential revenue impact of improving those gaps. Without clear visibility into trends driven by holidays and economic indicators, it becomes difficult to design targeted, ROI-driven retail strategies.

## 🔍 Key Analysis
- Analyzed weekly and monthly sales trends across all stores
- Compared sales performance during major holiday weeks (Thanksgiving, Christmas, Super Bowl, Labor Day)
- Evaluated sales behavior across different unemployment rate ranges
- Built KPIs for total sales, average weekly sales, and year-over-year change
- Modeled revenue recovery scenarios to estimate potential business impact

## 📈 Results & Insights
- Super Bowl and Labor Day weeks generated approximately **$12M each**, outperforming Christmas week sales by over **70%**.
- Christmas week sales averaged **$7M**, significantly below Thanksgiving week performance, indicating gaps in holiday promotions or inventory strategy.
- Walmart achieved its highest sales levels during **average unemployment periods (5–8%)**, outperforming high-unemployment environments.
- In **low-unemployment markets (<5%)**, sales dropped sharply, suggesting reduced appeal to higher-income consumers and potential market share loss.

Scenario analysis shows that closing these gaps could unlock an estimated **$42M in revenue recovery over three years** through improved holiday strategies and targeted market positioning.
